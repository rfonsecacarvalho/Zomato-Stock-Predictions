Zomato Stock price prediction


Zomato, a global restaurant discovery and food delivery platform, has gained significant attention in the stock market since its public listing. Like many technology companies, Zomato's stock price is influenced by a variety of factors, such as market sentiment, global economic conditions, company performance, and investor behavior. Predicting stock prices is inherently challenging due to the high volatility and complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Traditional statistical models, often struggle to capture these dynamics, especially when external factors and multivariate data come into play.

Machine learning (ML) models, on the other hand, offer powerful tools for analyzing such complex patterns. By leveraging multivariate data (e.g., historical prices, technical indicators, and engineered features), ML algorithms can better capture non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies, making them more suited for stock price prediction. These models help provide investors with more accurate forecasts, aiding in decision-making amidst the unpredictable nature of financial markets.
